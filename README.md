## Restoring this Project

### Ending with newer nuget packages
The Chat project is dependent on SignalR Core which has many dependencies to other preview libraries that are already obsolete.  
This means that those libraries aren't anymore available on the preview asp-net contribution nuget feed and you will get warnings about fetching newer packages.  
So far this hasn't turn out to be a problem, but there is always a chance of an breaking API change.

As a temporary fix, I plan to add the obsolete nugets as dlls directly into the project (libs folder).  
SignalR Core is expected to be final around 3Q 2017.
